## :crown: Advanced Minecraft MMORPG Engine
Equipment, Skills, Quests, Shops, Dungeons, Bosses, Pets, Achievements and much more!

It is highly discouraged to compile the plugin and use it for your server. It currently still has many hardcoded variables for the test.wauz.eu server and could even damage your files. However, if you are an experienced plugin developer yourself, feel free to use parts of the code for your own plugins, as long as you retain license and copyright notice.

## :sunrise_over_mountains: Delseyria Reborn
Delve into a fascinating world, full of dark dungeons, vicious monsters and mythical treasures!

There is currently a demo in development. The test server is not publicly accessible though. [Seven Ducks](https://github.com/SevenDucks) plans to create a full [MMORPG experience in Minecraft](https://seven-ducks.com/delseyria.html) by 2022, all without the need for mods or data packs. Unlike Wynncraft it will be completely open source and provide APIs to add your own Skills or Equipment, so we hope it's worth the wait. All content will be released on the DelseyriaRPG Minecraft server, as soon as the first stable build is ready.
